# The perfect vote

## Goals
### Anonymous
Neither the government nor your neighbors should be able to know how you voted,
unless you tell them.
### Verifiable
At any time, up to some arbitrary limit when ballots are destroyed, a recount
can be done. And at any time, a voter should be able to check his personal
voting record with what is on file with the governing body. This goal can
be in conflict with anonymity.
### Fraudproof
No person should be able to vote more than once. Only registered and currently
valid voters can cast votes. No voting by proxy, whether or not authorized
(this last is subject to debate; an authorized proxy vote may be considered
valid). This goal can also be in conflict with anonymity.
### Hackproof
A special case of fraud would be the ability to manipulate votes electronically
or otherwise, either by the vote counters or outside agents.
### Coercionproof
Nobody should be able to buy votes or intimidate voters into casting their
ballots for or against a particular measure or person. This ties in with
anonymity.
### Reliable
People should be able to be confident that a vote, once cast, is preserved
untouched.
### Robust
The system should be ready to go when needed, and not fail at any time during
the voting period.

## Current systems
To my knowledge, no current voting systems do a good job at anonymity. Your
neighbors may not know how you voted, but the government certainly does, or
at least *could*, by matching your vote to your name and signature.

Current systems range from good to abysmal at verifiability and degree
of fraudproofing, despite the abandonment of anonymity.

I don't know that coercion is a big problem in the United States, but I
imagine that in some (more) totalitarian countries, the lack of anonymity
would strongly favor votes for the currently ruling party.

Reliability and robustness vary according, primarily, to adoption of
technology, with paper ballots being the best, and voting machines pretty
much a crap shoot.

## New approach

Any attempt to improve these problems and outright failures should take
into account previous attempts, and try to come up with a blend of paper
and electronic methods that complement each other and preserve the
strengths of each.
